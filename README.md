***1. Executive Summary***

Enterprises increasingly operate in multi-cloud environments that span Azure, AWS, and on-premises platforms such as VMware. This complexity introduces security blind spots and compliance challenges.

To address these, we have deployed Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDCA) with integrated Microsoft Defender for Cloud across all cloud workloads. This initiative strengthens our cyber resilience, improves secure score, and ensures alignment with compliance frameworks like ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, and CIS Benchmarks.

***2. Scope & Objectives***

The implementation covers:

⚙️ Azure Subscriptions: VMs, App Services, Databases, Containers, Serverless.

⚙️ AWS Accounts: EC2, RDS, EKS, Lambda.

⚙️ VMware vSphere workloads via Azure Arc.

⚙️ Hybrid/On-Premises databases and applications.

Objectives:

⚙️ Establish centralized security visibility across multi-cloud.

⚙️ Enhance security posture via Microsoft Secure Score.

⚙️ Apply regulatory compliance standards.

⚙️ Automate threat detection and response workflows.

***3. Architecture Overview***

🔹 Azure Workloads

⚙️ Defender for Servers, Defender for SQL, Defender for App Services enabled.

⚙️ Security posture monitored in Defender for Cloud dashboard.

🔹 AWS Integration

⚙️ AWS accounts connected via native connector in Defender for Cloud.

⚙️ Continuous assessment against MCSB & CIS AWS Foundations.

🔹 VMware Integration (via Azure Arc)

⚙️ VMware workloads onboarded into Azure Arc.

⚙️ Defender for Cloud applied for VM-level and workload protection.

🔹 Containers & Serverless

⚙️ Defender for Containers enabled on AKS/EKS.

⚙️ Defender for Serverless applied to Azure Functions and AWS Lambda.

4. Deployment Prerequisites

⚙️ Enterprise Agreement (EA) or Microsoft CSP with Defender for Cloud Apps or Pay As You Go license.

⚙️ Azure Arc deployment on VMware clusters.

⚙️ AWS IAM role with required security read permissions.

⚙️ Standardized resource tagging policy across workloads.

⚙️ Defined incident response playbooks in Azure Sentinel (SIEM/SOAR).

5. Step-by-Step Implementation

1️⃣ Enable Enhanced Security Features Across Subscriptions

Enabled Defender Plans for all Azure workloads:

1) Navigate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud in Azure Portal portal.azure.com

2) Select Environment settings from the left menu

3) Choose your subscription (eg. CSP, Pay As You Go)

Enable the following Defender plans:

⚙️ Defender for Servers

⚙️ Defender for SQL Databases

⚙️ Defender for Storage

⚙️ Defender for App Service

⚙️ Defender for Containers

2) Navigate to Microsoft Defender for Cloud.

3) In Defender for Cloud, go to Environment settings.

4) Click + Add environment → Select Amazon Web Services.

5) Provide Connector details as below:

    i) Connector name, Onboard (Management or Single Account option)

    ii) Resource group

   iii) Location

   iv) AWS Account ID (found in AWS console under your profile).

   v) Create a connector stackset name and cloudformation on AWS using the template from Azure.
   - Download the cloudformation template
   - Deploy the stack on AWS by navigating to create stack - upload a template file and use the downloaded cloudformation from azure.
   - Provide the name of stack as ''DefenderConnectorStack'' and click on next - Review - Submit.
